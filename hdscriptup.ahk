::kkoptions::We have a few different options for that return.  For the fastest refund you can take that to your local store to process the return.  Or if it's more convenient I can set up for a carrier to come out and pick up the order at our expense.  Or I can also send a label to you to drop off at any UPS location.  Which would you prefer?
:*:kkpuups::Let me walk you through the next steps/process{:}{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}UPS will bring the label and make 1 attempt between the hours of 8am and 8pm ET Monday-Friday.{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}Please know, UPS DOES NOT CALL AHEAD, OR PROVIDE PACKAGING MATERIALS - your item(s) must be correctly packaged for shipping, and readily available for the driver to grab and tag{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}If UPS doesn't pick up the product on the first attempt, they will leave a return label behind for you (the customer) to use and return via a UPS store{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}{SHIFT down}{ENTER}{SHIFT up}Your credit will be issued within 3-5 business days after successful scan by UPS (at your home or at the store)

:*:kkdisp::The best option for you in order to get you taken care of would be to actually reach out to your credit card company that you used on the order and dispute the transaction.  Let them know the reasoning will be "I never received my merchandise."  This will not only get you your refund to you in the fastest way possible but will also start the investigation into what happened with the merchandise.
::ccdisp::Thank you for your patience. As the tracking shows it was delivered, I am unable to refund the item. I apologize for the inconvenience this causes you, I know that it can be frustrating. In these situations we want to make sure that all of the appropriate financial and legal steps are taken. To do this, the next step would be to dispute the charge with your financial institution. In most cases, they are able to get you the funds back very quickly, then make sure that the appropriate parties are involved if any legal action needs to be taken.
::kknodel::Unfortunately, once an item is showing delivered the order is completed and we don't have a lot of recourse at that point. Otherwise, I'm sure you could understand how people would abuse the system if they could tell us they never received an order when in fact that did.
::hibhc::However, I'd be happy to go ahead and get that order cancelled for you so that a new order can be placed with the correct pick up person listed on there?
::refproc::I have that processing for you back to your original form of payment. You will receive an e-mail here shortly confirming that refund as well as can expect those funds no later than 3-5 business days from today's date.
::qqbodfs::It looks like this is an order with merchandise being delivered from your local store. As such we don't have much access to those details here at online services. The store just asks that you contact them directly at for that info and they will be happy to help{!}
::kkaddc::With this type of order we don't have a way to update that shipping address to ensure the security of your personal information as well as to prevent theft/fraud. However, an option that may be possible is when you receive the shipping confirmation e-mail that has the carrier and tracking information you can then reach out to the carrier to change the address. Or if you have a registered account with UPS.com or FedEx.com there are even more options available to you.
::retnum::The return number is for our system use only at this time. The tracking number is all you will need.
::kkegc::I have that difference being refunded back to you in the form of an e-gift card{!} You can expect the e-mail with those details no later than 24 hours from now.


;Cancelations
:*:kkcnote::So I can be diligent in assisting you and keeping detailed notes, do you mind if I ask why you are wanting to cancel that order today?
:*:qqboss::It looks like this order is already at the vendor to ship out. With this type of order we just have to wait till it's in a shipped status and can then go in and cancel it for you. So, if you just send us another quick text once you receive the e-mail that says "your order has been shipped" with the tracking information on it we can get that cancelled right away. :)
:*:kksth::It looks like this order is already at the vendor to process and ship out so we don't have a way of modifying or canceling it at this point. However, once you receive the item, you are more than welcome to return to any store for the quickest refund{!} Or, we will even have a carrier come back out to pick up the item at our expense.
:*:qqcan::It looks like we are outside the window where we are able to cancel or make changes on that order. So at this time your best option for that return/refund will be to do a return once you've received that item. For the fastest refund I always suggest taking it to your local store{!} :)
::canconf::Alright, I have that cancelled. You will receive an e-mail here shortly with the confirmation of cancellation and can expect the refund from that no later than 3-5 business days.

:*:kkbodfs::When you see "Express Delivery" listed as a way to receive an item it is not being shipped from one of our online warehouses, it is being placed on one of that stores delivery trucks(or even "Uber") and driven to your location.You can be as specific as your budget allows for selecting a date and time for the delivery.You will need to decide if this delivery method is the best choice for your order.For thousands of our in -store items, you may see "free 2-day delivery" Look for the expected arrival date in your cart for specifics.
:*:kkbodfs2::I am seeing that this item is stocked only in selected stores and not in any of our warehouses here online. For your convenience, stores with this inventory can offer to place it on one of their trucks and deliver it to you. Is this delivery service something you would like more information on?
:*:kkboss::If you are placing your order as a ship to store order, you will be notified as your items arrive, but then the store will keep your order for you for 30 days, allowing sufficient time for your order to be received complete if you would prefer a single pick up trip.

:*:kkrepart::Recently, there was a change regarding replacement parts for orders that were shorted a part or item within a product. These vendors / manufacturers wanted direct contact with the purchaser (you) to remove the middleman, (us) from this process so you would receive your part much more quickly. Sorry for this inconvenience, but I am sure you will be pleased with the speed in which you receive your part.

:*:kkcache::Let's try clearing your cache and cookies; Do you know how to do that?  If not, I can try to walk you through it.
:*:kkfreight::Although there are many items that have free freight with a $45 order, there isn't an across the board dollar amount that triggers free freight. Home Depot pays freight on everything we send out; and does not set those prices. Sometimes the freight is absorbed, sometimes it can't be.

:*:kklink::Were you able to access the link I just sent you?
:*:kkquest::Am I answering your question adequately?
:*:kkfix::To fix this, if you remove the items from your cart, clear your cache and cookies, add the items back in the cart, then proceed you will be fine. If you are uncomfortable with that - you may phone the customer service line at 1-800-466-3337.
:*:kkadj::I will have to adjust your price after you place the order, but before the charge hits your credit card; this will be an adjustment, not a credit so the charge to your card will be less than you see on the order confirmation.
