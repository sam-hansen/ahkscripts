::qqhi::Hi{!} What can I do for you tonight?
::qqmin::It looks like it's been a minute since I've heard anything.Are you still there ?
::qqmin2::I haven't heard from you in a bit.  Just wanted to make sure you are still there and taken care of. :)    
::smsclose::Thank you again for reaching out today{ !} Please take a moment to complete our quick survey.Enjoy the rest of your day.   
::qqapdel::There must be someone 18 or older must be present.There must be a clear pathway for delivery.Delivery agents aren't licensed plumbers, carpenters, or electricians and cannot perform that type of work. Old accessories cannot be used.  Merchandise is not returnable to the manufacturer once signed for so please inspect at the time of delivery.  If you aren't fully satisfied at the time of the delivery, we advise you to refuse the item and not sign the delivery receipt.Any cosmetic damages need to be reported within 48 hours of delivery to the delivery services @877-946 - 9843.
::qqinst::Many times the installation is free when you buy the "required parts".The installers have to guarantee their work and can not do this using old parts.
::qqappl::Your appliances will be delivered and installed by our vendors who stock them for us.The stores don't have inventory per se, just the floor models; this helps ensure they are fresh and perfect when they arrive.
::qqbid::Yes there is installation available for this.I can have a professionally licensed person contact you directly, or you can call the "get it installed" number at 1 - 855 - 752 - 3352.
::qqbilling::When on the Secure Checkout screen, after entering the shipping address, be sure to un - check the box with "Use as Billing Address" if you are shipping to and address that differs from your Billing address.You will see more boxes appear where you can enter the correct Billing address.
::qqbodfs::When you see "Express Delivery" listed as a way to receive an item it is not being shipped from one of our online warehouses, it is being placed on one of that stores delivery trucks(or even "Uber") and driven to your location.You can be as specific as your budget allows for selecting a date and time for the delivery.You will need to decide if this delivery method is the best choice for your order.For thousands of our in -store items, you may see "free 2-day delivery" Look for the expected arrival date in your cart for specifics.
::qqbodfs2::I am seeing that this item is stocked only in selected stores and not in any of our warehouses here online.For your convenience, stores with this inventory can offer to place it on one of their trucks and deliver it to you.Is this delivery service something you would like more information on ?
::qqmaret::Nearly all of our appliances are actually tied to the stores, even if they are purchased online.When you enter your zip code into the site to place the order it is tied to your local store, and the order becomes part of that stores inventory.Appliances can be repaired or replaced if needed but the only person able to authorize a return is your local store manager.If you like I can get you that contact information.

::qqrepart::Recently, there was a change regarding replacement parts for orders that were shorted a part or item within a product.These vendors / manufacturers wanted direct contact with the purchaser(you) to remove the middleman, (us) from this process so you would receive your part much more quickly.Sorry for this inconvenience, but I am sure you will be pleased with the speed in which you receive your part.
